## 3.3. Patterns

As every other functionality, this one will follow the architecture defined for the application.
User Interfaces will be in the backoffice app package, controllers and domain will be on the
core package. Persistence classes such as the OrderRepository implementations will be on the
Persistence Package, although the interface will remain in the core.

# 4. Implementation

* The implementation follows the design presented above.

# 5. Integração/Demonstração
Implemented succesfully. Only dependency is having orders ready to be delivered in the database.

# 6. Observações

* This User Story is only used when there are ready orders.
