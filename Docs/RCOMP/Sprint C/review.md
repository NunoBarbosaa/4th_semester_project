# 1. Sprint's backlog #

  by an AGV and be able to ask/force any of those orders to be immediately prepared by an AGV available.

  the needs of the "BackOfficeApp" application as well as the needs the AGV digital twin.

* **US-4002** As Project Manager, I want that the "AGVManager" component is enhanced with a basic
  FIFO algorithm to automatically assign tasks to AGVs.

  of the AGV digital twin to accept requests from the "AGVManager".
