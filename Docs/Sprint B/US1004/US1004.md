# US1004 - Register a Customer
=======================================


# 1. Requirements

* This functionality is to be implemented in the backoffice application, and will be mostly used by Sales Clerk.

**Q&A with the client**

> **Question:** What should be the payment methods present on the program?
>
> **Answer:** You may, for instance, present Paypal and Apple Pay.

> **Question:** Should the shipment method price be managed later on by the company or it's a constant value that doesn't require future management?
>
> **Answer:** Should the shipment method price be managed later on by the company or it's a constant value that doesn't require future management?

> **Question:** Should the system be able to add more payment methods later on or are those payments always automatically received and have no verification needed?
>
> **Answer:** Yes. Multiple  payment methods can be added/supported. Currently, the team just need to be aware that is an extension point and prepare the system for that.

> **Question:** What are the parameters, i.e. what does a payment confirmation consist of?
>
> **Answer:** Regarding US1004 when a sales clerk creates a new order for a given customer, does the customer need to be registered in the system?

> **Question:** Regarding US1004 when a sales clerk creates a new order for a given customer, does the customer need to be registered in the system?
> 
> **Answer:** Most of the times, the customer is already registered. However, it might happen (s)he is not registered. In such case, the customer is registered on that moment using US1003.

> **Question:** The development team wonders if stock validation is required when ordering a product?
>
> **Answer:** Within this prototype, stock validation is definitively out of scope.

> **Question:** Is it required that the system keep an history of the order state? For example, if an order changes from "payment pending" to "to be prepared", are we required to keep the date of this change for future query?
>
> **Answer:** Keeping order state history, as suggested, is an interesting feature that will be highly appreciated/valued.

> **Question:** How do you want the clerk to select the products? By putting their id or selecting?
> 
> **Answer:** Both: by typing the product id when knowing it or by using searching/browsing the products catalog (US1002).

# 2. Analysis

## 2.1 What is needed to create an order behalf of a given customer:

* **Minimum required information:**
    * Name
    * VAT
    * Email Address
    * Phone Number

* **Optional information:**
    * Addresses (billing or delivering)
    * Birthdate
    * Gender

## 2.4 Relevant Domain Model

The following model represents what is needed to accomplish the functionality, in therms on domain concepts.

![US1003_SD](US1003_DMPartial.svg)

As seen in the diagram above, the Customer is the root of the aggregate and is an entity.
Customer has various Value Objects, like Gender, Email, BirthDate, PhoneNumber, VAT and Address.

# 3. Design

This functionality will be used by Sales Clerk, a UI will be added to the backoffice application.
In the core, a new package called Customer Management will be added, and it will contain the controller, domain classes
and persistence. To persist necessary data for this functionality, mainly the Customer information, a Customer repository will be needed.

## 3.2. Class Diagram

## 3.3. Patterns

As every other functionality, this one will follow the architecture defined for the application.
User Interfaces will be in the backoffice app package, controllers and domain will be on the
core package. Persistence classes such as the CustomerRepository implementations will be on the
Persistence Package, although the interface will remain in the core.

## 3.4. Tests

**Test 1:** Check if postal code is valid. In this example, three situation that the postal code is invalid.

# 4. Implementation

*Nesta secção a equipa deve providenciar, se necessário, algumas evidências de que a implementação está em conformidade com o design efetuado. Para além disso, deve mencionar/descrever a existência de outros ficheiros (e.g. de configuração) relevantes e destacar commits relevantes;*

*Recomenda-se que organize este conteúdo por subsecções.*

# 5. Integração/Demonstração

*The implementation of this User Storie is very important because it saves important customer data, such as billing and delivering addresses, and required to associate orders with the customer.*

# 6. Observações

*Customers register was done only with customer information. If the customer needs credentials for access to the application, this functionality must be implemented (3.1.5, mentioned by client) and the customer needs to be a user in the application.*
